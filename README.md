# Random Password Generator

## This Random Password Generator uses a series of prompts to take user input for limits on the password and generate a password.

This was an immensely challenging Challenge which pushed me to ask for help from several different TAs, other students, and a few tutorials. The biggest problems I had were getting started and also keeping my variable names straight. When I had trouble in the beginning, pseudo coding was very helpful just to organize my thoughts and get me thinking more step-wise. I learned a lot about where to declare variables and where to put console.logs as well as how to structure a for loop.
